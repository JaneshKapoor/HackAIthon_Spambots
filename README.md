Whenever we buy an electric vehicle, one needs to install majorly three applications onto our mobile phones

Application provided by the government to locate nearby govt charging stations
Application provided by EV manufacturers like OLA to check the battery and status of the EV.
Application developed by individuals/groups during hackathons like HackAIthon Jabalpur where people get a better understanding of how to improve the life of their EVs
ðŸ‘‰Introducing ElectriGo, a one-stop solution for every EV present in the market. It provides the ability to locate nearby both AC/DC private and public charging stations that are fetched using APIâ€™s provided by the government. The users can book the charging docks for a specific period of time before they reach there. Furthermore, the application offers emergency services like calling a battery swap van. Once called, users can effortlessly replace the battery of their electric vehicle, ensuring a seamless experience. Our application involves rigorous monitoring and maintaining the SOC of the EV. Using our ML algorithms, with high accuracy, we predict SOC which is used to calculate range estimation, battery health, etc.

We've also pinpointed a segment of significant stakeholders in the Indian EV market which is the rickshaw owners who lack Android devices. Specifically, there's a notable group of over 1.5 million+ battery-powered EV rickshaws. We have finally created a multilingual chatbot that provides support about the nearest charging station, open charging slots, etc. This chatbot has a very simple UI and it enhances accessibility to almost all the left-out audience.

With ElectriGo, we can dramatically enhance EV Adoptability in future and aim to bring standardisation in the EV industry by affiliating with the government and making it a mandatory thing for electric vehicles in the future.
